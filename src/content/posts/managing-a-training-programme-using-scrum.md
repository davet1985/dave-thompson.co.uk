__TL;DR__ - use an agile methodology to provide structure, rapid feedback, visibility, focus and motivation to an on-the-job training programme.

Whilst preparing an internal software development training programme I decided to use Scrum to manage the process. My knowledge and experience of using Scrum comes from the world of software development, after all, I am a software developer! Scrum is often perceived as a software development methodology, but it is infact just a framework for managing a process. Given this, I thought it was well suited to providing some structure to a training programme.
